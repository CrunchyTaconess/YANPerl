# YANPerl
A recreation of the YANP (Yet Another Nessus Parser) but in PERL.

YANPerl is a parser able to extract information from Tenable Nessus's .nessus file format. The main tool's objective is to export vulnerability assessment reports in a parsable way. The user is able to choose an appropriate output format in order to save the Nessus' reports following various advanced needs.

The original application (https://github.com/adipinto/yet-another-nessus-parser) by adipinto works in Python but I was unable to use it on one of my own machines. After hundreds of mindnumbing hours, I just recreated the program in PERL to parse these files.
